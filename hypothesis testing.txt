Hypothesis Testing

Our hypothesis was that the most effective factor that changes the satisfaction is the pricing, as price decreases, the satisfaction decreases too. We examined the relationship between the prices and the overall satisfaction and found out that as the price increases the satisfaction decreases. Also the most rated houses (according to the total number of satisfaction votes) were the ones with the lower prices. This shows us that our hypothesis is not correct, decrease in the price does not mean that the satisfaction decreases. However, we still do not know if the most effective factor that changes the satisfaction is the price of a house. To prove this part of the hypothesis we need to check the relation between the overall satisfaction and other effective factors.
